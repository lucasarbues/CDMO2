# CDMO

Inside this directory you can find the folders for the resolution of the final project.
All the parts of the project are based on python using different libraries that let us model correctly.
In order to reproduce the results it's enoguh to have the same instances files and run the code after the correct instalations of the libraries.
Following, we leave the commands to install the libraries.

## CP
pip install minizinc

## SMT
pip install z3-solver

## MIP
pip install gurobipy

Also, for MIP it is necessary to get a guroby license in order to have enough computational power to run long instances.
